# Independent-Study-AI-Registration-Assistant
This project is an AI-powered course-registration assistant developed as part of an independent study at Fairfield University. The tool uses Python and Streamlit to create an interactive web application that converts a studentâ€™s natural-language requests into concrete scheduling recommendations aligned with their degree requirements.
