Learning Objectives

This independent study focuses on developing practical skills in:

Applied Artificial Intelligence & NLP — Translating natural-language preferences into structured data models

Data Modeling & Automation — Representing academic rules computationally

User Experience Design — Creating a clear and informative interface for students and advisors

Outcomes

The prototype demonstrates how AI can enhance academic operations by:

Simplifying registration workflows

Providing data-driven, personalized course recommendations

Offering explainable logic for each scheduling decision

Ultimately, this project illustrates the potential for AI-driven advising systems to transform university registration into a more intuitive, equitable, and technology-enhanced experience.
