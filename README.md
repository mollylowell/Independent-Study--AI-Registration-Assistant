# Independent Study : AI Registration Assistant

## Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered course-registration assistant** developed as part of an **independent study at Fairfield University**. Built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, the tool demonstrates how artificial intelligence can streamline academic advising and registration through natural-language interaction.

Students can type plain-language requests such as:  
> “I need 15 credits, avoid Friday classes, and finish my ethics requirement.”

The assistant interprets these requests, converts them into structured academic constraints, and generates **conflict-free, degree-aligned schedules** that follow program rules and prerequisites. It also explains how each schedule supports a student’s degree progress, making the registration process transparent, efficient, and personalized.

## Key Features  
- **Natural Language Input:** Converts everyday language into registration logic  
- **Rule-Based Scheduling:** Models credit limits, prerequisites, and time conflicts  
- **Degree Progress Tracking:** Evaluates how schedules satisfy Magis Core, Dolan Core, and major/minor requirements  
- **Transparent Recommendations:** Provides reasoning for course suggestions  
- **Interactive Interface:** Built entirely in Streamlit for accessible web-based use

## Technical Stack  
| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Language** | Python |
| **Framework** | Streamlit |
| **Libraries** | Pandas, NumPy, JSON |
| **Data Inputs** | Course catalogs, degree-requirement schemas, mock student records |
| **Core Functions** | NLP interpretation, constraint generation, schedule optimization |

## Learning Objectives  
This independent study focuses on developing practical skills in:  
- **Applied Artificial Intelligence & NLP** — Translating natural-language preferences into structured data models  
- **Data Modeling & Automation** — Representing academic rules computationally  
- **User Experience Design** — Creating a friendly and informative interface for students and advisors  

---

## Outcomes  
The prototype demonstrates how AI can enhance academic operations by:  
- Simplifying registration workflows  
- Providing data-driven, personalized course recommendations  
- Offering explainable logic for each scheduling decision  

Ultimately, this project illustrates the potential for **AI-driven advising systems** to transform university registration into a more intuitive, equitable, and technology-enhanced experience.
